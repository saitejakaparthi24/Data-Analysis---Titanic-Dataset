# Data-Analysis---Titanic-Dataset
Performed Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate analysis on Titanic Dataset to analyze the limitations of Data Analysis with different parameters

Dataset Used	: Titanic Dataset.csv
Imagine stepping back in time to the tragic voyage of the Titanic. As we delve into the dataset, we uncover a wealth of information that paints a vivid picture of the passengers onboard. Let's embark on a journey filled with intriguing insights and compelling stories that capture the essence of the Titanic dataset. (Storytelling continued from Insights Gained section along with visualization diagrams).
Let us consider the Titanic Dataset sourced from Kaggle website and explore the data by visualizing a few key analyses using univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. To make it easier to understand, I discussed each visualization definition and story behind visualizing the solution.

Visualization Types: 
•	For univariate analysis, I used various visualization techniques such as pie charts, bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots to explore different aspects of the Titanic dataset.
•	For Bivariate Analysis, I used scatter plots, kernel density estimation (KDE) plots, and count plots to visualize the relationships between variables.
•	For multivariate analysis, I used Tree maps, Scatter plots, 3D Visualization and bubble chart to visualize the relationship between three or more than 3 variables.
